- Break long lines appropriately:
  - For HTML: Break at attribute boundaries or after opening tags
  - For CSS: Break after properties or selectors
  - For JavaScript: Break at logical points (after commas, operators, etc.)

## Indentation
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
- Maintain consistent indentation throughout the file

## File Formatting
- Always apply these rules when creating or modifying files
- Ensure proper formatting before committing changes
- **Maximum 1 consecutive blank line** - Remove any instances of 2 or more consecutive blank lines

## Git Rules
- **Do not perform `git commit` or `git push` unless explicitly requested by the USER.**
- Always wait for the USER's permission before executing any git commands that modify the remote repository or create new commits.
